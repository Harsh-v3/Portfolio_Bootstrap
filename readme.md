## Installation

In order to customize this website, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then, clone this repository and run:

1. **Clone the repository :**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harsh-v3/Portfolio_Bootstrap.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory :**

```bash
cd Portfolio_Bootstrap
```

3. **Install dependencies :**
   This will install Bootstrap, Sass and Font Awesome. To build your CSS files from Sass.

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Run :**

```bash
npm run compile:sass
```

You can add Bootstrap variables to the `bootstrap.scss` file. You can look at the file `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/scss/_variables.scss` for a list of all the variables. Do NOT edit the `variables.scss` file directly, as it will be overwritten when you update Bootstrap.

To add your own custom styles, use the `styles.scss` file.
